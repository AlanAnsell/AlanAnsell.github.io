#The main focuses of my research are
# * Cross-lingual transfer, where the plentiful data available in "high-resource" languages such as English is exploited to improve the performance of NLP systems in other languages, especially those with little readily accessible data.
# * Parameter-efficient and modular/composable fine-tuning. These techniques are aimed at making fine-tuning of large language models more accessible and efficient, and enabling multiple indepedent facets of knowledge to be combined in a single model.

I am a Research Scientist at Google Research in Sydney, Australia, working on Gemini multilinguality.

I completed (grad. pend.) a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Cambridge's Language Technology lab, where I was supervised by [Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/), [Ivan Vulić](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) and [Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). I am grateful to have been funded by the [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholarship](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/).


In 2024, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research Montreal, working on modular fine-tuning of LLMs with [Alessandro Sordoni](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/alsordon/) and [Lucas Caccia](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~lpagec/).

I previously obtained a Masters degree in Computer Science, specialising in Natural Language Processing, at the University of Waikato under the supervision of [Bernhard Pfahringer](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~bernhard/) and [Felipe Bravo-Marquez](https://felipebravom.com/). I was an undergraduate at the University of Auckland, completing a conjoint Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) / Bachelor of Arts degree.

I am a former bronze medallist at the International Olympiad in Informatics and completed two software engineering internships at Google. I got interested in AI through game AI programming. You can find my third-place winning entry to the 2018 CodeCup international game AI programming competition [here](https://github.com/AlanAnsell/blackhole).
